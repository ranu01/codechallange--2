# INTRODUCTION

# JavaScript Code challange 2

> This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript code challenges:

Swap Case
Generate Number Range Array
Find Prime Numbers

# DESCRIPTION

# Challenge 1: Swap Case (stringinput.js)

> This challenge has to enable a function that swaps the case of each character in a given string.

# Challenge 2: Generate Number Range Array (numbersjs)

> This challenge we have created function that takes two numbers as input and returns an array containing all integers between those numbers (inclusive). The function should handle both positive and negative ranges.

# Challenge 3: Find Prime Numbers ( primenum.js)

> In this challenge we have created a function that accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.

# SOLUTIONS

The solutions for each challenge are provided in separate JavaScript files:

# string.js

# numbersjs

# primenum.js

These files can be run independently to test the functionality of each solution.
